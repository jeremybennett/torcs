Brondehach (Brands Hatch Circuit)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...is largely a conversion to TORCS of a Brands Hatch track, created for
a game called SBK2001 by "Milestone".

His work was released without any license (so far as I can tell) and as such has
been ported to several other games, including SCGT, Racer and VDrift.

With this conversion I have redesigned the track layout to accurately reflect that
of today's Brands Hatch circuit - although I've had to guess at road heights and
cambers based on various descriptions of the track.

As such, it has some challenging off-camber corners, interesting slope changes and
a difficult chicane which sends cars airborne if they approach it too quickly or 
on the wrong line. Nevertheless its quite a fast track that can be very enjoyable
once you've mastered it.

The name Brondehach is Gaelic, meaning both "wooded slope" and "forest entrance".
